>One aspect that may seem confusing at first is that there are two entities named app. The app package is defined by the app directory and the __init__.py script, and is referenced in the from app import routes statement. The app variable is defined as an instance of class Flask in the __init__.py script, which makes it a member of the app package.

其一，这里有两个实体名为app。 app包由app目录和__init__.py脚本来定义构成，并在from app import routes语句中被引用。 app变量被定义为__init__.py脚本中的Flask类的一个实例，以至于它成为app包的属性。

- [ ] variable
